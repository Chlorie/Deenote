# Grammar of this file:
# The first line is Language code
# The second line is the language name that will display in application.
#
# Format 'key=value' defines a localized text, change the right part to change the display text
# Use <br/> escape new line
# Use {0} define parameters
# Use 'key="""' start a multi-line text, a multiline text should end with a line that is '"""'
#     If the end-line mark has leading space, all lines will remove leading space with a max number of end-line's leading space
#     (Actually similiar with c# raw string https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/raw-string
#
# An empty line or a line contains only white space is ignored
# A line starts with '#' is ignored. (It looks like markdown but is actually not xD

## Developers

Dialog_AboutDevelopers_Page_HCl_Title=HCl
Dialog_AboutDevelopers_Page_HCl_Content="""
    Hello everyone, I'm Chlorie. Feel free to call me HCl if you'd like. I'm the original developer of the first version of Deenote. When I started working on it, I was still an undergrad student, and now, in the blink of an eye, I'm about to graduate from my Ph.D. program, and Deemo has long since become a relic of the past. What I mean to say is that time truly flies.

    Back when I first created Deenote, I was a complete novice in programming. I learned C♯ and Unity as I went along, hacking together the tool bit by bit. Looking back, ignorance really was bliss — the code structure was messy, but somehow, I managed to get the core features working. Since then, I've often thought about continuing to maintain Deenote — improving the codebase, redesigning the UI, adding new features, and such. However, while my programming skills have grown, I've gone to the other extreme: each time I tried to refactor the project, I'd get halfway through, feel something being “off”, and start all over from scratch. In the end, I was never able to produce a finished product.

    As Confucius once said, “What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others”. Well, since I no longer had the drive to get the refactor done, I just imposed the task onto Trarizon (wait, what?)... In any case, I'm deeply grateful to Trarizon for taking over the project and for all the hard work that followed!

        This is NachtgeistW, or you can call me Nightwheel. For some reasons, I forked this project and tried to learn C# while fixing deenote.
        I'm a junior in a Chinese University. Origin developer HCl has graduated with excellent grades, now he is a graduate student.
        Version 0.7.3 gets the help from Blurring Shadow. Thank you.
        I don't know what I will bring for this project, so... don't expect.
        Last of all. Thank you for using Deenote.

        This is Trarizon. I started refactoring this project after finishing my undergraduate project, and for many reasons I just about to finish it now.
        
        I completed main features of Deenote v1.0 on late March, and was tired so had a rest. And now build version 1.0 under push of qq group friends

        I don't know if I will have time to continue optimizing this project, so don't expect too much...

        PS: Actually I didn't planed to complete the project when i forked the repository last year, I just want to see how far I could go. So the news about me working on the project past few months was mostly spread by Chlorie.jpg
        Thanks to Chlorie for years of relentless nagging.jpg
