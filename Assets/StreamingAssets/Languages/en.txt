    Deenote By HCl

    *Bad English Alert*

    -Things that must be mentioned-
        Thank you for using my app!
        Something I must mention in the beginning: This application can only be used to make fan made charts of Deemo, and it is strictly prohibited to use this app for any commercial purposes. This app is only for making fan made charts for fun, if you somehow know methods to import fan made charts into the game, DO NOT distribute the cracked/modified game to others (or even make it public). You  ll probably have a bad time if you do so.

    -Random things-
        [Self-introduction?]
        I'm a rhythm game player known as HCl on the Internet. I'm 17 years old and currently studying Computational Mathematics in USTC (University of Science and Technology of China) for the third year.
        [About this app?]
        I'm making this app just for fun. Still a C#/Unity3D newbie so there may be tons of bugs in my code, but who cares? (No, everyone cares.) Since I'm still a student, and as you all know everyone is pretty busy in the third year in university, so I don't have much time to develop this thing. Don't push me please.
        About the drag-and-drop file opener added in 0.5.6, I  m using a dll coded and compiled by my friend Schwarzer (The one working on Lanotalium, an easy-to-use Lanota chart editor. That guy does awesome works, you really should check him out.) You know who to blame and what to do if that specific thing goes wrong. XD
        [Anything else?]
        Just enjoy yourself making some fun charts with this app. Hope you love it.

    -Known bugs-
        Many bugs about UI and shortcut keys (for example if you try to open another project while you're still in the piano sound editing screen, the piano would probably stay there and it may cause some problems). It's not that I don't know how to fix but it's really a tedious job and it will take much time... Please give me enough time...
        Some buttons may not work cause the functions are not yet implemented. Please wait...

    -If you've found more bugs or want to suggest some new features-
        Feel free to start an issue on Deenote's github repository, the link is: https://github.com/Chlorie/Deenote/issues . You'd better not to contact me by QQ or E-mail or something...
     
    -Special thanks-
        Thanks to the developers of Cytunity and Deemo Note Memory for inspiration.
        Thanks to Schwarzer for the drag-and-drop library he made!
        Millions of thanks to rkevin and     for technical support!

    *Bad English Alert*

        This is NachtgeistW, or you can call me Nightwheel. For some reasons, I forked this project and tried to learn C# while fixing deenote.
        I'm a junior in a Chinese University. Origin developer HCl has graduated with excellent grades, now he is a graduate student.
        Version 0.7.3 gets the help from Blurring Shadow. Thank you.
        I don't know what I will bring for this project, so... don't expect.
        Last of all. Thank you for using Deenote.
